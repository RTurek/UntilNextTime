# UntilNextTime

This was just a fun little app that I built for my girlfiend (then fiance, and now wife) to use when we were dating long distance and traveling to see each other every few weeks. We could have it up on our phones or as the homepage on our web browsers. Ah to be young and in love!

I plan to build this into an app for anyone to use to set up a countdown timer for when they will see each other again, or for any special occasion.
